# Cellular Automata Program - Rule 30
--------------

This project implements Rule 30 Cellular Automata with both sequential and parallel programming versions. The parallel version utilizes MPI (Message Passing Interface) in C, demonstrating concepts learned in my COMP 620 Computer System Architecture course. The project explores the efficiency and performance differences between sequential and parallel processing.
